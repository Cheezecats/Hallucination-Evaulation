The reduction of Berserk Stance damage from 10% to 5% in World of Warcraft is a significant and widely discussed change. It was implemented with patch **20.3**.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of why it happened:\n\n*   **The Root Cause:** The primary reason for this change was attributed to an issue with how Blizzard's physics engine (specifically, the collision system) handled the Stance effect.  They discovered that the 10% damage reduction wasn't perfectly consistent across all enemies and conditions. Some enemies, particularly those with high armor or specific attack patterns, were still registering a significant amount of damage even when in Berserk.\n\n*   **The Fix:** The developers addressed this by tweaking the physics calculations within the Stance mechanic.

The Crescent Axe's unique gameplay revolves around its \"Stagger\" mechanic, which dramatically reduces incoming damage.  Here's the breakdown:\n\n*   **Stagger Effect:** When you hold the Crescent Axe in two hands and block, you trigger a \u201cStagger\u201d effect. This is a temporary reduction in damage taken from all sources (including attacks, spells, and even enemy attacks).\n*   **Magnitude of Stagger:**  The degree of stagger depends on a few factors:\n    *   **Angle of the Axe:** Holding the axe at a 90-degree angle to your face results in significantly more stagger. This is *essential* for maximizing the effect.\n    *   **Distance from the Enemy:** The further away you are, the less stagger you get.\n    *   **Enemy's Attack Speed:** Faster attacks will result in less stagger and faster damage taken.\n\n* **How Stagger Works:**  When you're holding the Axe in two hands and blocking, a small amount of damage is reduced to both your character and enemies as they attack. This reduction is tied to the \"Stagger\" effect.

The algorithm then partitions the input vectors into these medoids based on their similarity, aiming for a good balance between similarity and distance.\n\n*   **k = 1:**  Setting `k=1` is a common choice because it's considered to provide a reasonable level of separation without being overly aggressive. It means that each input vector is assigned to *exactly one* medoid, which is often sufficient for many applications.  It's a good starting point and helps prevent the algorithm from creating too many medoids, which can lead to instability in subsequent steps.\n\n**Important Note:** The exact value of `k` may vary slightly depending on the specific PAM implementation used by the authors of the paper.

While the official investigation concluded that it was a tragic accident, the prevailing theory and the most widely accepted explanation points to **John Fleming**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the evidence and theories:\n\n*   **The Official Theory (John Fleming):** The police initially believed that Vicky died from a fall while attempting to climb out of the stables. However, inconsistencies in the evidence \u2013 particularly the lack of a clear impact point on the wall and the placement of the fallen body \u2013 led investigators to suspect foul play.

He was consistently portrayed as having a history of violence and a deep-seated resentment towards Vicky.  He had previously been involved in a volatile relationship with her, and there were numerous instances of him threatening her and attempting to control her. His detailed knowledge of the stables and his ability to manipulate events suggest he played a significant role in the accident.\n\n*   **Other Theories:** While John Fleming is the leading suspect, other possibilities have been suggested, including:\n    *   **A possible robbery gone wrong:** There were rumors of a potential robbery at the time of the incident, though this has not been", "The Aseprite v1.3-beta1 was released on **September 28, 2016**.\n\nYou can find more detailed information about its release date on their official website: [https://aseprite.com/v1.3/](https://aseprite.com/v1.3/)", "The saboteur in Season 1 of Big Brother was **Nick**.\n\nHe systematically sabotaged several people, including:\n\n*   **Sarah:** He repeatedly tried to trick her into revealing her secret.\n*   **Danielle:** He created a situation where she had to confront him and ultimately revealed her secret.\n*   **James:** He deliberately set up James for elimination by planting false evidence.\n\nIt was Nick's manipulative tactics that led to his victory in Season 1.", "Track number 6 on disc 1 of the Sen no Kiseki IV - The End of Saga original soundtrack is called **\"Aoi Uta\" (Blue Song)**.", "According to the 2011 Census, the population of the Anantnag district was **369,475**.", "Janak Patel was murdered on **December 29th, 2023**.", "Clyde Pinelands Football Club was established in **1923**.", "The surname of the recipient of the Nyholm Prize for Education in 1973-74 was **Svensson**.\n\nIt was awarded to **Ingrid Karlsson**.", "The investigation into the Ice Truck Killer has been a complex and ongoing process, and identifying a single \"potential suspect\" remains incredibly difficult.

Giraffes have **three intervertebral discs**, which are essentially rubbery, shock-absorbing cushions between each vertebra. These discs act as flexible \"hinges\" that allow for a wide range of movement \u2013 crucial for their long neck flexibility.\n\n**2.  Synovial Joints (Cartilaginous Joints):** These joints are formed by the articulation of the vertebrae themselves and the intervertebral discs. They\u2019re characterized by:\n   * **Articular Cartilage:** The joint surfaces are covered in articular cartilage, which reduces friction between the bones and allows for smooth movement.  This is a key feature that allows for such flexibility.\n\n\n**3.  Limited Movement - \"Flexion-Extension\" Joints:** While their necks can rotate up to 270 degrees (a remarkable feat!), they primarily move through flexion and extension \u2013 essentially \u201cbending\u201d the neck. This is achieved through these joint types:\n   * **Saddle Joints:** These are a key feature of giraffe vertebrae.

The change in Hoes's Breaking Moss block behavior to utilize the Snapshot mechanic is a brilliant example of how Minecraft\u2019s core mechanics can be dramatically altered through careful coding tweaks.\n\nHere's the breakdown of what happened and why it\u2019s so significant:\n\n**The Core Problem:**\n\n* **Original Hoes Behavior:** Before Snapshot, Hoes had a very limited range of attack options \u2013 primarily focused on fire and breaking blocks.  Their \"breaking\" was often unpredictable and difficult to control.\n* **The Snapshot Solution:** The core of the change is in how Hoes's attack patterns are triggered and how they interact with the environment.  Specifically, the snapshot mechanic introduces a *dynamic range* to their attacks, allowing them to target areas beyond their usual range, significantly increasing their effectiveness against moss.\n\n**Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key changes:**\n\n1. **The Snapshot Trigger:** Hoes now uses a \"Snapshot\" trigger that occurs when they're within 5 blocks of a Moss block. This is a crucial element.\n2. **Range Expansion:**  This snapshot trigger dramatically expands Hoes' range, allowing them to attack moss even *further* than they typically could.  They can now target moss blocks at a distance of up to 10 blocks!\n3. **Damage Application:** When they hit moss, Hoes now apply a damage that is *slightly", "Jerry Lee Lewis\u2019s 13th album, \u201cThe Soul of the Blues,\u201d was released in **1972**.", "The team that came second in Group C in the 2018-19 UEFA Champions League was **FC Barcelona**.", "Iftikhar Hussain Ansari joined the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (NC) in **1984**.\n\nHe was a key figure in the NC's leadership during that period.\n", "Spencer Perceval left office as the Attorney-General for England and Wales in **1862**.\n", "The case of Nidal Khalid Nasrallah v.

Traditional methods were ineffective, leading to significant pain and damage.\n* **Ellie\u2019s Approach:** Dr. Jones developed a technique utilizing a powerful magnet to gently pull the debris from the eye. She meticulously positioned the magnet to create a \"vacuum\" effect, drawing the metal fragments out with minimal trauma to the surrounding tissue.\n* **Her Technique & Significance:** This method was revolutionary and marked a significant advancement in ophthalmology. It demonstrated that magnets could be used safely and effectively for surgical procedures.\n\n**Important Note:** While Dr. Jones\u2019s technique is widely recognized, there's some debate about its precise details.

Abolitionists were vehemently opposed to slavery and sought to help enslaved people escape to freedom.\n*   **The Backlash:** The council, attempting to balance public safety with the moral outrage surrounding slavery, granted a license to a tavern keeper who was perceived as a potential source of agitation and potentially inciting unrest. This tavern keeper was reportedly involved in a dispute with local abolitionist villagers who felt they were being harassed and threatened.\n*   **The Council's Response:** The council feared that the tavern keeper's presence would lead to increased violence and disorder, potentially attracting more people to the town. They decided to issue a single license to suppress the situation.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that this was a very unusual and controversial decision at the time given the strong opposition to slavery in Ontario.
