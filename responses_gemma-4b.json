He would have been a young assistant at the time, and the angel\u2019s garment is one of the few areas that seem particularly detailed and luxurious\u2014a level of craftsmanship not typical of Verrocchio\u2019s usual style. \n* **Why It Was Missed for So Long:** The signature was so faint it had to be enhanced with infrared reflectography (revealing hidden details beneath layers of paint) and ultraviolet light to be seen.\n\n**Therefore, the prevailing theory is that the angel's garment belongs to Sandro Botticelli.**\n\n\nDo you want me to delve into any specific aspect of this debate, such as:\n\n*   The history of the", "The municipality of La Uvita, Boyac\u00e1, Colombia was founded by **Don Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez**.\n\nHe is considered the \"founder\" and a key figure in its establishment.

This allowed Aramco to handle extremely large and complex reservoirs that were previously intractable for traditional simulation methods.\n\n*   **Integration with Data Analytics:** A key innovation was the integration of data analytics techniques, like machine learning, into the simulation workflow.

It's estimated to be around 20.3 parsecs (66 light-years), but there's some uncertainty in this value, which affects the calculated magnitude.\n* **Measurements and Calculations:** Astronomers use several techniques to estimate star brightness, including:\n    * **Parallax measurements:**  These are used for relatively nearby stars.\n    * **Spectroscopic analysis:** Analyzing the star\u2019s light spectrum helps determine its temperature and luminosity.\n    * **Photometry:** Measuring how bright a star appears through different filters.\n\n**Why the magnitude is important:**\n\nMagnitude is a logarithmic scale of brightness. Lower magnitudes mean brighter stars. A difference of 1 magnitude represents a factor of 2.5 in brightness.

For example, she pronounced \"water\" closer to \"wader,\" and \"house\" more like \"hoes.\"\n    * **Vocabulary:** She incorporated Cornish words and phrases into her speech \u2013 sometimes directly, sometimes adapting them into English equivalents.

Here's a breakdown of why and what the best estimates are:\n\n**The Challenges in Determining an Exact Time:**\n\n* **Variations in Conditions:** Flight times varied dramatically based on several factors:\n    * **Wind Speed & Direction:** Headwinds would significantly increase the time to climb.  Tailwinds reduced it.\n    * **Altitude at Takeoff:** Starting at a higher altitude gave the Albacore a head start.\n    * **Pilot Skill and Technique:** Experienced pilots could optimize their climb profile.\n    * **Aircraft Condition & Weight:** A well-maintained, lightly loaded Albacore would climb faster.\n    * **Engine Temperature & Performance:**  A cold engine or one struggling to maintain power would slow the climb.\n* **Limited Official Records:** Precise timing data wasn\u2019t consistently recorded for every flight in combat or training. Operational records often focused on mission success rather than individual climb times.\n* **Taurus XII Engine Characteristics:** The Taurus XII was a complex, stressed-over-machined engine with relatively low power output compared to some contemporary aircraft engines.

This is a notoriously tricky and debated topic among players due to the game's somewhat opaque mechanics.\n\n**The Official (and Somewhat Confusing) Answer:**\n\nAccording to official documentation and community consensus, holding the Crescent Axe with two hands *drastically* reduces block damage compared to using one hand. Here\u2019s what you get:\n\n*   **One-Handed:** Block Damage Reduction = 80%\n*   **Two-Handed:** Block Damage Reduction = **95%** (This is the key number!)\n\n**Why is it so high?**\n\nThe reason for this massive reduction in damage taken while blocking with two hands isn\u2019t explicitly stated by FromSoftware. However, several theories have emerged:\n\n1.  **Increased Stability & Weight:** The Crescent Axe's large size and weight when wielded two-handed provide a significant degree of stability.

You\u2019ll often find yourself needing to time blocks perfectly and avoid hitting the enemy for extended periods after a parry attempt.\n* **Predictable Attacks:** Many enemies telegraph their attacks, making it tempting to try and parry frequently.

It decays via beta decay into <sup>180</sup>W (tungsten).\n* **Production in Stars:** The vast majority of naturally occurring <sup>180</sup>Ta is formed during the supernova explosions of massive stars. These supernovae create extremely high neutron fluxes, which cause rapid neutron capture (the \"r-process\") \u2013 a process that builds up heavier elements like tantalum.  The abundance of <sup>180</sup>Ta reflects the conditions in those supernovae and how efficiently it\u2019s produced.\n* **Measurement Challenges:** Measuring such low abundances is incredibly difficult. Scientists use techniques like:\n    * **Mass Spectrometry:** Analyzing the ratios of different isotopes in meteorites (which are thought to have a significant proportion of supernova-produced elements) provides clues.\n    * **Cosmochemical Modeling:**  Sophisticated models that simulate the conditions within supernovae and their impact on elemental abundances help constrain the <sup>180</sup>Ta production rate.\n\n\n**Key takeaway:** While <sup>180</sup>Ta exists naturally, it\u2019s a very rare element due to its radioactive nature and its formation", "Brian Griffiths passed away in **Oxford**, England.

Here's what we know and how we can estimate:\n\n**What We Know:**\n\n* **Early Career (Pre-1938):** Kodaira began publishing quite early, primarily in Japan. His early work focused on topics like the theory of harmonic spaces.\n* **Move to Germany (1938):** He moved to Germany as part of a Japanese academic exchange program in 1938. This is a crucial point because his later, more influential work was largely produced *while* he was in Germany.\n* **Limited Records:**  Records from this period, especially for Kodaira\u2019s early publications, are not always easily accessible or comprehensively digitized. Many papers were published in journals that aren't as readily available online.\n\n**Estimating the Number (as of 1941):**\n\nBased on research and compiled information, here\u2019s a reasonable estimate:\n\n* **Pre-1938 (Japan): Approximately 10-15 papers.** This includes publications in journals like *Journal de Math\u00e9matiques Pures et Appliqu\u00e9es*,  *Transactions of the University of Tokyo (Mathematical Society)*, and others.

She described psychic secretions as \"invisible emissions\" that emanate from people when they are experiencing strong emotions \u2013 particularly fear, anxiety, or excitement. She claimed these emissions could be sensed by other psychically sensitive individuals and even used to predict events.\n\n* **The Mechanics (as she theorized):** Dixon believed that these secretions were a form of psychic energy released through the nervous system during emotional surges.  She described them as having a specific \"color\" or \u201caura\u201d associated with different emotions.  For example, fear might produce a dark, smoky emission, while joy would be brighter and more golden.\n\n* **Subsequent Development:** While Dixon's ideas were intriguing, they weren\u2019t universally accepted within the psychic community. Later, other psychics and researchers (including some who studied her work) expanded on the concept, adding their own interpretations and attempting to scientifically investigate its potential basis.

However, KEGG pathways are incredibly complex and represent biological processes, not individual drugs. \n\nHydroxyzine\u2019s effects (antihistaminic, sedative, anxiety-reducing) relate to several interconnected pathways. Here's how you can think about it within the KEGG framework:\n\n* **HETEROZYGATINE PATHWAY (hsa04130):** This pathway is *most closely related*. Hydroxyzine\u2019s primary mechanism of action involves its metabolism into hydroxyzine hydrochloride, which then acts as an antagonist at H1 histamine receptors.

You'll find this pathway under the KEGG ID **hsa04130**.\n\n* **Histamine Signaling Pathway (hsa04010):** As an antihistamine, Hydroxyzine directly impacts histamine signaling. This is a major component of the HETEROZYGATINE pathway and involves many other related pathways within KEGG.  The main ID for this broader category is **hsa04010**.\n\n* **Serotonin Signaling Pathway (hsa04020):** Hydroxyzine also has serotonergic activity, contributing to its sedative and anxiolytic effects.

It\u2019s characterized by its ability to evoke strong emotional responses directly from the audience through rhythm, sound, and imagery. Importantly, it's not simply about beautiful language; it\u2019s about *affecting* the soul.

He considers music to be the art that most directly translates feeling into a concrete, audible form. It's the art that can express emotions without relying on language. The power of music lies in its ability to move us through its emotional tone and rhythm\u2014it\u2019s \u201ca pure expression of feeling.\u201d\n\n3.  **Painting:** Painting is considered the *least* fundamental of the three Romantic arts, but still crucially important. Hegel views painting as a mediating art between poetry and music. It takes the abstract emotions expressed in poetry or music and gives them a visual form.  While it doesn't directly evoke feeling like poetry or music, it can represent and suggest emotional states through color, composition, and form. Importantly, Hegel argues that painting *must* be guided", "This is a surprisingly complex and debated topic within DC Comics lore!

She used her plant control abilities to trap him and suffocate him. This is how it was presented for decades.\n\n**The Shift with the New 52:**\n\n* **DC Comics officially stated that *Black Lightning* #38 (2011) retconned the story.**  In this issue, it\u2019s revealed that **Black Lightning himself** killed Ratcatcher. Here's how it happened:\n    * Black Lightning discovered Malcolm Shortcut was being manipulated and controlled by a demonic entity\u2014a \"Rat God\"\u2014and that the Rat God was actively causing harm to innocent people. \n    * Black Lightning attempted to sever the connection between Malcolm and the Rat God, believing he was doing what was right for Gotham.

He built two telescopes in 1839 \u2013 one for himself and another for the Royal Observatory of Paris.\n* **The Key Difference: The Focal Shutter:**  Bidon\u2019s crucial contribution was his development of a *focal shutter* (also called a \"secondary mirror shutter\"). This ingenious device, placed within the focal point of the primary mirror, blocked light from falling on the sensitive film or photographic plate used for recording images.  This allowed for much longer exposure times than previous reflecting telescopes, which were limited by the brightness of the image at the focal plane.\n* **Early Gregorian Designs:** Before Bidon, other scientists and inventors had experimented with the Gregorian design (using a concave primary mirror and a convex secondary mirror). However, these early designs suffered from problems with stray light and impractical shutter mechanisms. \n\n**Important Note: Prior Attempts & Others' Contributions**\n\nIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that there were earlier attempts at building similar telescopes by others, including:\n\n* **Christian Huygens (1678):**  Huygens is credited with", "The first recipient of the Knuth Prize was **Donald Knuth** himself!
